INTRANET is the generic term for a collection of private
computer networks within an organization. An intranet
uses network technologies as a tool to facilitate
communication between people or work groups to improve
the data sharing capability and overall knowledge base of an
organization's employees.
<br>
A network that uses technologies of internet protocol to
share any type of information within association or Business
Company is called Intranet. This technology is used in the
proposed system, the “Intranet Mailing System” to make the
most out of this technology. This will somehow automate
the information passing system.
